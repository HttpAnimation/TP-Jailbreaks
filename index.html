                3) Spam the **F12** button if your laptop does not have **F12** then use a extrnal keyboard or boot into the bios witch so the bios pass key is **qazwsx** then change the boot order from **drive -> usb drive -> others** to **usb drive -> drive -> others** then reboot.

                4) You should see a screen like this one listed below use the arrow keys and hover over your usb drive then hit enter once you get to the usb drive hit enter then wait.

                5) In a little bit you will a see a screen as follows once here you are officaly jailbroken and you can use stop here and just boot off the usb drive when you ever you wanna boot into it or you can install it witch is recommand to do as the live boot is really really slow.
